# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Extend type definitions for health check functionality
  - Add new InstanceStatus enum values (HEALTH_CHECKING, READY)
  - Create HealthCheckConfig, EndpointHealthCheck, and HealthCheckResult interfaces
  - Extend InstanceState interface to include healthCheck field
  - Extend MonitorInstanceJobPayload to include healthCheckConfig
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Create HealthChecker service class
  - Implement HealthChecker class with performHealthChecks method
  - Create checkEndpoint method with HTTP request logic and retry mechanism
  - Implement parallel endpoint checking using Promise.allSettled
  - Add error categorization and response time tracking
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.2, 4.1, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance configuration system for health check settings
  - Add healthCheck section to Config interface
  - Define default values for timeout, retry attempts, and delays
  - Update config validation to include health check parameters
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Modify handleMonitorInstance method in JobWorkerService
  - Add health check phase after instance reaches "Running" status
  - Integrate HealthChecker service into monitoring workflow
  - Update instance state transitions (Running -> Health_Checking -> Ready)
  - Handle health check timeout and failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 2.3, 3.1_

- [x] 5. Enhance instance state management
  - Update InstanceService to handle new status values
  - Add methods to track health check progress and results
  - Implement state persistence for health check data
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Update webhook notification system
  - Modify webhook payload to include health check results
  - Add health check status information to notifications
  - Create specific webhook events for health check completion
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive error handling for health checks
  - Implement specific error types for different health check failures
  - Add detailed logging for health check progress and failures
  - Handle network timeouts and connection errors gracefully
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Create unit tests for HealthChecker service
  - Test individual endpoint health checking logic
  - Test parallel endpoint checking functionality
  - Test retry mechanism and timeout handling
  - Test error categorization and response time tracking
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.2, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Create unit tests for enhanced monitoring workflow
  - Test handleMonitorInstance with health check integration
  - Test instance state transitions during health checking
  - Test health check timeout and failure scenarios
  - Test webhook notifications with health check data
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 10. Add integration tests for complete health check workflow
  - Test end-to-end monitoring with health checks enabled
  - Test specific port targeting functionality
  - Test health check configuration override scenarios
  - Test webhook integration with health check results
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 3.3_
