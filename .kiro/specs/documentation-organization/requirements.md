# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project currently has numerous documentation files scattered in the root directory that should be properly organized in the `/docs` folder. This creates confusion for developers and makes it difficult to find relevant documentation. The goal is to consolidate all documentation into a well-structured docs folder, eliminate duplicates, and ensure all internal references are updated accordingly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all documentation to be organized in the docs folder, so that I can easily find and navigate project documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the root directory THEN I SHALL see no loose documentation files (*.md files except README.md)
2. WHEN I access the docs folder THEN I SHALL find all documentation properly categorized
3. WHEN I need specific documentation THEN I SHALL be able to locate it through a clear folder structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate documentation to be removed, so that I don't get confused by conflicting or outdated information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are duplicate files THEN the system SHALL keep the most comprehensive and up-to-date version
2. WHEN duplicate content exists THEN it SHALL be merged into a single authoritative document
3. WHEN I search for documentation THEN I SHALL find only one source of truth for each topic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all internal documentation references to be updated, so that links continue to work after reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation files are moved THEN all internal links SHALL be updated to reflect new paths
2. WHEN I click on documentation links THEN they SHALL resolve to the correct files
3. WHEN documentation references other files THEN the paths SHALL be accurate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want implementation summaries to be consolidated, so that I have a clear history of what has been implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple implementation summaries exist for the same feature THEN they SHALL be consolidated into a single document
2. WHEN I need to understand what was implemented THEN I SHALL find comprehensive implementation documentation
3. WHEN implementation details are documented THEN they SHALL be organized by feature or component

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear documentation index, so that I can quickly navigate to the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the docs folder THEN I SHALL find a comprehensive index of all documentation
2. WHEN I need specific information THEN the index SHALL guide me to the right document
3. WHEN new documentation is added THEN the index SHALL be updated accordingly
