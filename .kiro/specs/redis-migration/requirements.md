# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely removing all in-memory storage systems (cache and job queue data) and replacing them with Redis-only solutions using Upstash. This will eliminate dual-mode operation, remove fallback mechanisms, and ensure all data persistence, caching, and job processing relies exclusively on Redis for improved consistency, scalability, and distributed deployment capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want cache data to persist across application restarts, so that I don't lose cached data when the service is redeployed or restarted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application restarts THEN previously cached data SHALL remain available
2. WHEN cache entries have TTL remaining THEN they SHALL continue to expire at the correct time after restart
3. WHEN the Redis connection is established THEN existing cache metrics SHALL be preserved or recalculated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want job queue data to persist in Redis, so that queued jobs are not lost during application restarts or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application restarts THEN pending jobs SHALL remain in the queue
2. WHEN a job is being processed and the application crashes THEN the job SHALL be returned to pending status
3. WHEN jobs are completed or failed THEN their status SHALL be persisted for historical tracking
4. WHEN the Redis connection is established THEN job processing SHALL resume automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want seamless Redis integration with Upstash, so that I can use managed Redis without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis credentials are provided via environment variables THEN the connection SHALL be established automatically
2. WHEN the Redis connection fails THEN the application SHALL handle the error gracefully with appropriate logging
3. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the application SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. IF Redis connection is lost THEN the application SHALL attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing cache and job queue APIs to remain unchanged, so that no code changes are required in services that use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to Redis THEN all existing CacheService methods SHALL maintain the same signatures
2. WHEN migrating to Redis THEN all existing JobQueueService methods SHALL maintain the same signatures
3. WHEN using Redis-only services THEN the behavior SHALL be identical to previous in-memory versions
4. WHEN cache or job operations are performed THEN the response times SHALL remain within acceptable limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Redis operations to be properly monitored and logged, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis operations are performed THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN Redis errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full error context
3. WHEN Redis connection status changes THEN it SHALL be logged and monitored
4. WHEN Redis operations have high latency THEN performance warnings SHALL be logged

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for Redis operations, so that temporary Redis issues don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis operations fail THEN appropriate errors SHALL be thrown with descriptive messages
2. WHEN Redis is temporarily unavailable THEN operations SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN Redis operations timeout THEN the application SHALL handle it gracefully
4. IF Redis becomes permanently unavailable THEN the application SHALL fail fast with clear error messages indicating Redis dependency

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want Redis data to be properly serialized and deserialized, so that complex data structures are preserved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing cache data in Redis THEN complex objects SHALL be serialized correctly
2. WHEN retrieving cache data from Redis THEN objects SHALL be deserialized to their original form
3. WHEN storing job data in Redis THEN job payloads SHALL maintain their type integrity
4. WHEN handling Date objects THEN they SHALL be preserved correctly through serialization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Redis configuration to be flexible and environment-specific, so that I can use different Redis instances for development, testing, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Redis THEN connection parameters SHALL be read from environment variables
2. WHEN Redis configuration is invalid THEN clear validation errors SHALL be provided
3. WHEN different environments are used THEN Redis configuration SHALL be easily switchable
4. WHEN Redis configuration changes THEN the application SHALL validate the new settings

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all in-memory storage completely removed from the application, so that Redis is the single source of truth for all cached data and job queues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN no in-memory Map or Set data structures SHALL be used for caching or job storage
2. WHEN services are initialized THEN they SHALL only use Redis-backed implementations
3. WHEN fallback cache services exist THEN they SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
4. WHEN cache managers are used THEN they SHALL only create Redis-backed cache instances
5. WHEN job queues are accessed THEN they SHALL only use Redis-backed job queue services
6. WHEN the application runs THEN all persistent data SHALL be stored exclusively in Redis
