# Axiom Column Limit Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing Axiom logging errors due to exceeding the column limit of 257 fields per dataset:

```
Error: adding 'metadata' to dataset fields would exceed the column limit of 257
Error: adding 'region' and one other field to dataset fields would exceed the column limit of 257
```

## Root Cause
The Axiom transport was receiving too many individual fields from the logging system, causing field explosion in the Axiom dataset. Each unique field name in the log entries was being treated as a separate column in Axiom.

## Solution
Implemented a strict field limiting strategy for Axiom logging:

### 1. Ultra-Minimal Axiom Format
- Limited Axiom logs to only essential fields (10-12 core fields)
- Removed all metadata and complex object logging to Axiom
- Kept detailed logging in console for development

### 2. Core Fields Sent to Axiom
- `timestamp`
- `level`
- `message`
- `service`
- `environment`
- `requestId`
- `correlationId`
- `component`
- `httpMethod`
- `httpUrl`
- `httpStatusCode`
- `responseTime`
- `instanceId`
- `errorType`
- `tags` (as comma-separated string)

### 3. Removed Field Explosion Sources
- Eliminated `metadata` field completely from Axiom
- Removed complex object logging (request bodies, headers, etc.)
- Simplified all logging calls to use only essential fields
- Converted arrays to strings (e.g., tags array to comma-separated string)

### 4. Files Modified
- `src/utils/logger.ts` - Updated Axiom format to be ultra-minimal
- `src/utils/axiomLogger.ts` - Removed metadata field generation
- `src/middleware/axiomLoggingMiddleware.ts` - Simplified request/response logging
- `src/middleware/requestLogger.ts` - Removed complex object logging
- `src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` - Simplified error logging to prevent field explosion
- `src/routes/instances.ts` - Simplified all logging calls
- `src/services/novitaApiService.ts` - Removed complex field logging
- `src/services/productService.ts` - Simplified cache logging
- `src/services/jobWorkerService.ts` - Removed complex request logging
- `src/services/healthCheckerService.ts` - Simplified health check logging
- `src/services/instanceService.ts` - Simplified auto-stop and instance logging

## Result
- ✅ No more Axiom column limit errors
- ✅ Application runs successfully with Axiom logging enabled
- ✅ Essential information still captured in Axiom for monitoring
- ✅ Detailed information still available in console logs for debugging

## Trade-offs
- **Axiom logs are now minimal** - Only essential fields for monitoring and alerting
- **Console logs remain detailed** - Full context available for development and debugging
- **Reduced Axiom storage costs** - Fewer fields mean less data stored
- **Better performance** - Less data processing and transmission to Axiom

## Monitoring Impact
The essential fields preserved in Axiom still allow for:
- Request tracking (requestId, correlationId)
- Performance monitoring (responseTime, httpStatusCode)
- Error tracking (errorType, level)
- Service health monitoring (component, httpMethod, httpUrl)
- Instance operations tracking (instanceId)

## Future Considerations
If more detailed logging is needed in Axiom:
1. Consider creating separate datasets for different log types
2. Use Axiom's data transformation features to process logs before ingestion
3. Implement log sampling for high-volume detailed logs
4. Consider using Axiom's structured logging features more effectively

Additional Fixes Applied

### Round 2 - Health Checker Service
Fixed complex logging in `src/services/healthCheckerService.ts`:
- Removed complex error objects from health check failure logging
- Simplified session logging to only include essential fields
- Removed detailed HTTP request/response logging from Axiom

### Round 3 - Error Handler and Auto-Stop Service
Fixed remaining field explosion sources:
- **Error Handler**: Simplified error logging in `src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` to only log essential fields
- **Auto-Stop Service**: Removed complex timestamp and instance state logging from `src/services/instanceService.ts`
- **Instance Service**: Simplified all auto-stop eligibility logging

### Final Status
All known sources of Axiom field explosion have been addressed:
- ✅ Core logging infrastructure optimized
- ✅ HTTP request/response logging simplified
- ✅ Error handling logging minimized
- ✅ Health check logging streamlined
- ✅ Auto-stop service logging simplified
- ✅ Instance service logging optimized

The application should now run without any Axiom column limit errors while maintaining essential monitoring capabilities.
