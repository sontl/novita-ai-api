# Implementation Changelog

This document provides a consolidated history of key implementations and feature additions to the Novita GPU Instance API service.

## Major Feature Implementations

### Auto-Stop Feature
**Implementation Date**: September 2024  
**Status**: Complete

Automatically stops running GPU instances when they haven't been used for a configurable period (default 20 minutes) to optimize costs.

#### Key Features:
- Last used time tracking with `PUT /api/instances/{instanceId}/last-used` endpoint
- Background monitoring service running every 5 minutes
- Configurable inactivity thresholds (default 20 minutes)
- Dry run support for testing without actual stopping
- Job queue integration for reliable background processing

#### API Endpoints Added:
- `PUT /api/instances/{instanceId}/last-used` - Update last used timestamp
- `GET /api/instances/auto-stop/stats` - Auto-stop statistics
- `POST /api/instances/auto-stop/trigger` - Manual trigger with dry-run support

#### Technical Changes:
- Added `lastUsed?: Date` to InstanceState timestamps
- Added `lastUsedAt?: string` to InstanceDetails
- Created `AutoStopService` for scheduling and execution
- Integrated with job queue system (`AUTO_STOP_CHECK` job type)

### Instance Synchronization & Web UI
**Implementation Date**: September 2024  
**Status**: Complete

Comprehensive startup synchronization between Novita.ai and Redis, plus a web management interface for GPU instance management.

#### Key Features:
- **Startup Synchronization**: Automatic sync on application startup
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Removes instances from Redis that no longer exist in Novita.ai
- **Web Management UI**: Clean, responsive interface with instance management controls
- **Bulk Operations**: Stop all running instances with one click
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates data every 30 seconds

#### Technical Changes:
- Created `StartupSyncService` for instance synchronization
- Added `src/public/index.html` with responsive web UI
- Added Redis lock mechanism to prevent concurrent sync operations
- Created API endpoints for manual sync and bulk operations

#### API Endpoints Added:
- `POST /api/instances/sync` - Manual synchronization trigger
- `POST /api/instances/stop-all` - Bulk stop operation

### Obsolete Instance Synchronization
**Implementation Date**: September 2024  
**Status**: Complete

Enhanced synchronization to handle instances that exist in Redis but no longer exist in Novita.ai, ensuring data consistency.

#### Key Features:
- Identifies obsolete instances (exist in Redis but not in Novita)
- Configurable handling strategies (mark as terminated vs remove completely)
- Retention policies for terminated instances (default 7 days)
- Detailed sync statistics and logging

#### Configuration Options:
- `SYNC_REMOVE_OBSOLETE_INSTANCES` - Remove vs mark as terminated
- `SYNC_OBSOLETE_INSTANCE_RETENTION_DAYS` - Retention period for old instances
- `SYNC_ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_SYNC` - Enable automatic sync
- `SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` - Sync frequency

### Enhanced Startup Error Handling
**Implementation Date**: September 2024  
**Status**: Complete

Comprehensive error handling for startup operations with detailed logging and recovery mechanisms.

#### Key Enhancements:
- **Enhanced Error Types**: Specific error classes for different failure scenarios
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with intelligent retry decisions
- **Detailed Logging**: Enhanced observability with operation context
- **Client-Friendly Responses**: Meaningful error messages with actionable suggestions

#### New Error Types:
- `StartupTimeoutError` - For startup operation timeouts
- `StartupFailedError` - For general startup failures with retry information
- `HealthCheckTimeoutError` - For health check timeouts during startup
- `ResourceConstraintsError` - For resource availability issues
- `NetworkError` - For network-related failures with retry information

### Timestamp Validation Fix
**Implementation Date**: September 2024  
**Status**: Complete

Fixed "Invalid time value" errors in the auto-stop service caused by invalid timestamp values in instance states.

#### Problem Solved:
- Null timestamps in instance data
- Invalid Date objects causing crashes
- Type inconsistency in timestamps (strings, Date objects, null values)

#### Solution:
- Added `validateAndFixTimestamps()` function to clean and validate timestamps
- Enhanced Redis loading with proper Date object conversion
- Individual instance error handling to prevent entire operation failure
- Fallback to sensible defaults for invalid timestamps

## System Architecture Evolution

### Core Services
- **Instance Service**: Central orchestration for all instance operations
- **Novita API Service**: Interface to Novita.ai API with retry logic and error handling
- **Job Worker Service**: Background job processing with monitoring
- **Auto-Stop Service**: Automated instance management based on usage patterns
